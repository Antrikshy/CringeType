CringeType
==========

Type like an @NnoYiNG tWEâ‚¬N, an INT3rN3T trO11 etc etc.

CringeType does some rudimentary text modification to make your text input sound cringeworthy, allowing you to type like an Internet troll who is trying way too hard.

This website was built in under 4 hours, in my free time, so there isn't much to it. Feel free to clone and add more bells and whistles. Pull requests are always appreciated. If you're new to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this is a nice project that you can play around, because the code is fairly simple.

CringeType is a front-end-only website that runs entirely in your browser.
